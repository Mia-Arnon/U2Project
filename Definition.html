<p> The website https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health of the organization Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration writes about mental health. According to them, mental health is "our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices."
