      <h1>What is mental health?</h1>
  </div>

  <p>The organization Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration writes about mental health. According to them, mental health is "our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices."
